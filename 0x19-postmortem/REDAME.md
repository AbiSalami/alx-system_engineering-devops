*"When your database query decides to take a vacation during peak hours..."*

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
June 8, 2024, 14:30 - 16:00 UTC

**Impact:**  
Our main web application experienced a significant slowdown, affecting approximately 75% of users. Users reported extended load times and intermittent timeouts when attempting to access the service. The frustration was real – like waiting for a snail to finish a marathon.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was an unoptimized database query introduced during a recent deployment, which led to excessive load on the database server. Who knew a single line of code could bring everything to a halt?

## Timeline

- **14:30 UTC:** Issue detected by automated monitoring system due to a spike in response times. (A collective groan was heard across the office.)
- **14:32 UTC:** Initial investigation began by the on-call engineer, focusing on server logs and application performance metrics. (Frantic keyboard smashing ensued.)
- **14:40 UTC:** Customer complaints started coming in, confirming widespread user impact. (Emails pouring in like an avalanche.)
- **14:45 UTC:** Assumptions made about potential server resource exhaustion led to misleading investigations into server CPU and memory usage. (Barking up the wrong tree.)
- **15:00 UTC:** Escalation to the database team after application logs pointed to slow database queries. (Time to bring in the heavy artillery.)
- **15:15 UTC:** Database team identified the problematic query introduced in the latest deployment. (Eureka!)
- **15:20 UTC:** Rollback of the recent deployment initiated to restore previous stable state. (The "undo" button, our best friend.)
- **15:45 UTC:** Deployment rollback completed; monitoring confirmed gradual recovery in response times. (Breathe, everyone, breathe.)
- **16:00 UTC:** Full service restored, and incident resolved. (Cue the celebratory coffee break.)

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The outage was caused by a newly introduced database query that was not properly optimized. The query resulted in full table scans on a large dataset, which significantly increased the load on the database server and caused a bottleneck in processing user requests. It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack by examining every piece of hay.

**Resolution:**  
The resolution involved rolling back the recent deployment to the previous stable version of the application. This rollback removed the problematic query and returned the system to normal operating conditions. Additionally, the database team optimized the query to avoid full table scans, ensuring it would perform efficiently when reintroduced in a future deployment. Think of it as swapping out a rusty gear for a shiny new one.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements/Fixes:**  
- Implementing more robust testing and optimization for database queries before deployment.
- Enhancing monitoring to include specific alerts for slow database queries. (No more surprises, please.)
- Updating deployment procedures to include performance regression testing.

**TODO List:**
1. **Optimize Database Query:**
   - Refactor the problematic query to use appropriate indexing and reduce load.
2. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Add detailed monitoring for database query performance.
   - Set up alerts for query execution time exceeding predefined thresholds.
3. **Update Deployment Process:**
   - Integrate database performance tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Conduct load testing as part of the deployment process to identify potential performance issues before production.
4. **Training and Documentation:**
   - Provide training for developers on writing optimized database queries.
   - Update documentation to include guidelines for performance testing and monitoring.
5. **Review and Improve Incident Response:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the incident response to identify areas of improvement.
   - Update the incident response playbook to include steps for rapid identification and mitigation of database-related issues.

*"All's well that ends well – until the next deployment!"*

By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall reliability and performance of our web application.
