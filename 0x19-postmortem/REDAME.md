Postmortem: June 8, 2024 - Service Outage
Issue Summary
Duration:
June 8, 2024, 14:30 - 16:00 UTC
Impact:
Our main web application experienced a significant slowdown, affecting approximately 75% of users. Users reported extended load times and intermittent timeouts when attempting to access the service.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was an unoptimized database query introduced during a recent deployment, which led to excessive load on the database server.
Timeline
14:30 UTC: Issue detected by automated monitoring system due to a spike in response times.
14:32 UTC: Initial investigation began by the on-call engineer, focusing on server logs and application performance metrics.
14:40 UTC: Customer complaints started coming in, confirming widespread user impact.
14:45 UTC: Assumptions made about potential server resource exhaustion led to misleading investigations into server CPU and memory usage.
15:00 UTC: Escalation to the database team after application logs pointed to slow database queries.
15:15 UTC: Database team identified the problematic query introduced in the latest deployment.
15:20 UTC: Rollback of the recent deployment initiated to restore previous stable state.
15:45 UTC: Deployment rollback completed; monitoring confirmed gradual recovery in response times.
16:00 UTC: Full service restored, and incident resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a newly introduced database query that was not properly optimized. The query resulted in full table scans on a large dataset, which significantly increased the load on the database server and caused a bottleneck in processing user requests.
Resolution:
The resolution involved rolling back the recent deployment to the previous stable version of the application. This rollback removed the problematic query and returned the system to normal operating conditions. Additionally, the database team optimized the query to avoid full table scans, ensuring it would perform efficiently when reintroduced in a future deployment.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Implementing more robust testing and optimization for database queries before deployment.
Enhancing monitoring to include specific alerts for slow database queries.
Updating deployment procedures to include performance regression testing.
TODO List:
Optimize Database Query:
Refactor the problematic query to use appropriate indexing and reduce load.
Enhance Monitoring:
Add detailed monitoring for database query performance.
Set up alerts for query execution time exceeding predefined thresholds.
Update Deployment Process:
Integrate database performance tests in the CI/CD pipeline.
Conduct load testing as part of the deployment process to identify potential performance issues before production.
Training and Documentation:
Provide training for developers on writing optimized database queries.
Update documentation to include guidelines for performance testing and monitoring.
Review and Improve Incident Response:
Conduct a thorough review of the incident response to identify areas of improvement.
Update the incident response playbook to include steps for rapid identification and mitigation of database-related issues.
By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve the overall reliability and performance of our web application.
